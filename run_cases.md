The statement that the linear transformation of a subspace is also a subspace can be proven based on the given contents. A subspace of a vector space is defined as a subset of the vector space that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.

A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors from one vector space to another, preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. This means that for any two vectors u and v in the domain vector space, and any scalar c, the following properties hold:

1. Homogeneity: T(c * u) = c * T(u)
2. Additivity: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)

Given that the domain of the linear transformation is a subspace, and the transformation preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication, it follows that the image of the transformation, which is the range of all possible output vectors, will also be closed under these operations.

Therefore, the image of a linear transformation, when the domain is a subspace, is itself a subspace of the codomain vector space. This is because the image is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, which are the defining properties of a subspace.

In summary, the linear transformation of a subspace is indeed a subspace, as the transformation preserves the properties that define a subspace.
